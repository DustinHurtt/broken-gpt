      "response": "The function 'prompt()' belongs to the JavaScript native code, meaning it is a built-in function provided by the JavaScript engine itself. It is commonly used to display a dialog box to the user with a message and an input field, allowing the user to enter a response.\n\nWhen the 'prompt()' function is called, it displays a dialog box with the specified message as a prompt to the user. The function then waits for the user to enter a value and click either the 'OK' or 'Cancel' button.\n\nIf the user clicks 'OK' and provides an input value, the function returns the value entered as a string. If the user clicks 'Cancel' or closes the dialog box, the function returns 'null'.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the 'prompt()' function in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nvar userInput = prompt('Please enter your name:');\n\nif (userInput !== null) {\n  console.log('Hello, ' + userInput + '!');\n} else {\n  console.log('User cancelled the prompt dialog.');\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the code displays a prompt dialog asking the user to enter their name. If the user provides a value and clicks 'OK', it will be assigned to the variable 'userInput'. The code then checks if the value is not 'null' (which means the user didn't cancel), and if not, it logs a greeting message including the user's name. If the user cancels or closes the dialog box without entering a value, the code logs a message indicating the prompt was cancelled.",

      "response": "The function `prompt()` is not [native code]. It is a built-in function in JavaScript that displays a dialog box to the user, prompting them for input. However, if you want to make a list of possible answers, you can modify the `prompt()` function by using an argument to specify the available choices. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction promptWithList(choices) {\n  var message = \"Please select one of the following:\\n\";\n  for (var i = 0; i < choices.length; i++) {\n    message += (i + 1) + \". \" + choices[i] + \"\\n\";\n  }\n  \n  var userInput = prompt(message);\n  \n  if (isNaN(userInput) || userInput < 1 || userInput > choices.length) {\n    alert(\"Invalid input. Please try again.\");\n    return promptWithList(choices);\n  }\n  \n  return choices[userInput - 1];\n}\n\nvar options = [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"];\nvar selectedOption = promptWithList(options);\n\nconsole.log(selectedOption);\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a new function `promptWithList(choices)` that takes an array of choices as a parameter. It then constructs a message by iterating over the choices and displaying them with a corresponding index number.\n\nWhen the `promptWithList()` function is called, it displays the message and prompts the user for input. If the user enters an invalid input (like a non-number or a number outside the range of available choices), it displays an alert and prompts again.\n\nFinally, the function returns the selected choice, which can be stored in a variable or used as needed.",

However, here are some general tips:\n\n1. Start with clean hands or utensils (fork, knife, or pizza cutter).\n2. If eating with hands, hold the slice from the crust, not the toppings.\n3. Take small bites to fully enjoy the flavors.\n4. Consider folding the slice in half, especially if it's a large slice or a New York-style pizza.\n5. Avoid excessive toppings or sauces that may cause the slice to become messy or difficult to handle.\n6. Use napkins to wipe your hands and mouth as needed.\n7. Remind yourself to savor and appreciate each bite, as pizza is meant to be enjoyed.\n\nRemember, eating pizza is ultimately a flexible experience, so feel free to experiment and find what works best for you.",
